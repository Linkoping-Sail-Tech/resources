> Yes, you could use a public toilet and not wash your hands. Yes, you could eat spaghetti with your fingers. But responsible adults just don’t do those things. Nor do they ship untested code. And by the way, I no longer hate software that I’ve been working on for a while.

> Key Point: once you formulated the tests in terms of data, you no longer need to write code to add your tests. If code is not required, you can generate test cases easily.

> This semantic picture is made even muddier by the definition of Integration Test, which makes “unit test” look tightly defined. The take-away here is when anyone starts talking about various testing categories, dig deeper on what they mean by their words, as they probably don't use them the same way as the last person you read did.

> We found the majority of catastrophic failures could easily have been prevented by performing simple testing on error handling code – the last line of defense – even without an understanding of the software design. We ex- tracted three simple rules from the bugs that have lead to some of the catastrophic failures, and developed a static checker, Aspirator, capable of locating these bugs.
